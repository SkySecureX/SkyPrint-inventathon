# SkyPrint
SkyPrint is a cross-platform desktop application that saves paper by preventing unnecessary content from being printed. It has a user-friendly Graphics User Interface that uses browser automation to remove the unnecessary content. 

# Why SkyPrint?
When we want to print out an article/document, we immediately press Ctrl + P or Command + P and press enter without even thinking about it. This sub-conscious act results in waste of paper and ink from unnecessary white spaces, images, captions, advertisements, irrelevant text to be printed. This fast-paced society disintegrates our ability to be eco-conscious about printing.
