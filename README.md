# SkyPrint
SkyPrint is a cross-platform desktop application that saves paper by preventing unnecessary content from being printed.
It has a user-friendly interface that uses browser-based automation to remove unnecessary content.

## Why SkyPrint?
When we want to print out an article/document, we immediately press Ctrl + P or Command + P and press enter without even thinking about it.
This subconscious act results in wasted paper and ink from unnecessary whitespace, images, captions, advertisements, and other irrelevant text.
Our fast-paced society disintegrates our ability to be eco-conscious about printing.
SkyPrint solves these issues by removing the aforementioned unneccessary content, saving not only money, but the planet as well.
